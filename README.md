# COMP472 Project 1

- **Due Date:** October 18, 2021
- **Late Submissions:** 30% per day
- **Teams:** You can do the mini-project in teams of at most 3. Teams must submit only 1 copy of the mini-project via the team leaderâ€™s account.
- **Purpose:** The purpose of this mini-project is to make you experiment with machine learning.

## Experiments with Machine Learning
For this mini-project, you will experiment with different machine learning algorithms and different data sets.
As you will use built-in functions from the scikit-learn Library, the focus of this mini-project lies more on the
experimentations and analysis than on the implementation.

## Your Tasks

You will perform 2 tasks: a text classification task to better understand the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,
and another classification with a variety of types of features to better appreciate how to work with other types
of data and machine learning models. You must use:

1. Python 3.8 and the scikit-learn library. Scikit-learn (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) provides
an interface to program with a variety of different algorithms and built-in datasets. There are plenty of
tutorials and examples of code online.

2. GitHub (make sure your project is private while developing).
